The city of Rewa can be approached from Satna or Allahabad. It is 52 Kms. from Satna on Howrah-Bombay route and 127 Kms 
from Allahabad. there are regular private and Govt. bus services from both the places. it takes nearly one hour to reach from Satna 
and three and a half hours from Allahabad. some luxury and long distance buses take even less time to reach. Recently it has been 
connected from Satna by a railway line. it is now connected by rail from Bhopal and Jabalpur via Satna/Katni/Itarasi
