<h1 style="color:dodgerblue">Single Platform for all requirements</h1>
<p style="font-size:22px">The aim of the Student Hub network was to be a unique platform where students can seek
 the opinion of older, experienced colleagues. Guided by that idea, our software development
  team has created the modern and user-friendly place for gathering students and sharing
   information.
</p>
<h1>How does the Student Hub work ?</h1>
<p style="font-size:22px">With a few simple steps, one can easily connect with colleges from similar majors and discuss,
 share and comment current events, impressions from exams and anything else related to the
  particular subject, professor, university course.</p>
  <p style="font-size:24px">If you are already a student or you are going to become one, you can join the website free of
  charge and participate in a growing network dedicated to helping all students.
